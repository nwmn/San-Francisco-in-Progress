							<li> <h1> How It All Began </h1> <img class="placeholder" src="edu img/placeholder1.png" style="float:right" /> <br />

							<div class=“indent”> Al and Marian Ilitch opened their first Al's Pizza restaurant in San Francisco, California more than 50 years ago.

							It was an exciting time for Al and Marian Ilitch as they worked together toward that grand opening day of May 8, 1959. </div> </li> 

							<li> <h1>

							Commitment to Core Values</h1> <img class="placeholder" src="edu img/placeholder2.png" style="float:left" /> <br />

							<div class=“indent”>

							Throughout its history, Al's Pizza has provided quality pizza at a great price, resulting in outstanding value for customers. Quality and value are core values at Al's Pizza, but the brand also represents passion, fun, commitment and a focus on family. These characteristics are reflected in our breakthrough advertising and marketing campaigns that are remembered by customers for decades. Pizza!Pizza! is an iconic phrase that resonates with customers, who remember fondly the advertising associated with it.

							Giving back has always been a part of the way Al's Pizza does business. Unique programs such as Al's Pizza youth hockey, the Al's Pizza Love Kitchen, and the Al's Pizza Veterans Program have made a difference for millions of people through the years. </div> </li> 

							<li> <h1> Realizing the American Dream </h1>

							<div class=“indent”>

							It has been a remarkable ride for the entire Al's Pizza family, from colleagues, to franchisees, vendors and crew members. Al and Marian have demonstrated that achieving the American dream is possible for those who dream big, take risks and work hard. Along the way, they have shared opportunities with others and earned respect by demonstrating humility. </div>
